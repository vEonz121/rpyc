<h3 align="right">using RPYC</h3>

## üìë Description

BitFold is a peer-to-peer distributed computing approach on the k-fold cross validation process for support vector machine models. BitFold runs on three entities which are the **Client**, **Server**, and **Registry**.

1. **Clients** - Query the registry for available servers and distribute each fold to every available server within the network to cross validate. The results of which, are to be returned as an array of accuracy scores across all folds
2. **Servers** - Provide computational resources for the network to perform cross validation on a fold distributed to them from other clients
3. **Registry** (_Middleware_) - Keeps track of each server within the peer-to-peer network and provide the list of available servers for clients to use

This process of distributed k-fold cross validation is performed sequentially on each fold. This means that each fold is distributed, split, and trained one after another once the client initiates the process. In the future, this process will be deserialized to further increase speeds.

## üòè‚Äã How It Works

#### Clients `Client.py`

**Running the Client**

```py
# Import the FoldDistributor class
from Client import FoldDistributor

# Initialize the FoldDistributor with nFolds of 2
skf = FoldDistributor(num_of_folds)

# Ping Connected Servers
skf.ping_services()

# Distribute and Process the Folds
accuracy = skf.distribute_folds(data, target, model)

print(accuracy)
```

The client can be run by importing the `FoldDistributor` class from `Client.py`. The code snippet shows an example of how the class can be used.

**Initializing the FoldDistributor Client**

```py
class FoldDistributor:
  def __init__(self, nFolds):
    print(f"List of Found Services: {r.list_services(timeout=10)}")
    if len(r.list_services(timeout=10)) < nFolds:
      raise Exception("Not enough services available.")

    self.nFolds = nFolds
    self.establish_connection()
```

`FoldDistributor` is the class which is initiated as the client.

On initialization, the `__init__` method is called and the number of folds requested is passed. The client will then attempt to retrieve the list of available services from the registry. If there is no reply within 10 seconds, the client will timeout. If the number of listed servers within the network does not meet the number of folds requested, the client will raise a `Not enough services available` exception. Otherwise, the client will initialize itself with the number of folds requested, `nFolds` as its number of folds to be cross validated, `self.nFolds` and calls the method `establish_connection`.

```py
def establish_connection(self):
  self.services = [r.connect_by_service(f"FOLD{k}", config = {"allow_public_attrs" : True}).root for k in range(self.nFolds)]
```

`establish_connection` will then attempt to connect to servers within the network relative to the number of `nFolds` set for the client (i.e. 3 servers for 3 folds).

```py
# Import the FoldDistributor class
from Client import FoldDistributor

# Initialize the FoldDistributor with nFolds of 2
skf = FoldDistributor(2)
```

Client Output: `List of Found Services: ('FOLD0', 'FOLD1')`

Here, the `FoldDistributor` class is imported from the `Client.py` file and is initialized with `nFolds` of 2. The initialization should return the list of servers which it is connected to.

**Pinging Servers**

```py
def ping_services(self):
  successful = 0
  for s in self.services:
    if s.exposed_ping(): successful += 1

  return f"There are {successful} out of {len(self.services)} services responded to the ping."
```

The client can then ping the servers it is connected to using the `ping_services` method which can be used to gauge the health of the servers which it is connected to.

```py
# Ping Connected Servers
skf.ping_services()
```

Client Output: `'There are 2 out of 2 services responded to the ping.'`

**Distributing and Processing Folds**

```py
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
import pandas as pd

def distribute_folds(self, data: pd.DataFrame, target: pd.Series, model: LinearSVC) -> list:
  # build indices of each fold
  skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=self.nFolds, shuffle=True)

  # for each fold, train on fold remotely
  results = list()
  for i, (train_i, test_i) in enumerate(skf.split(data, target)):
    # build the request Object
    requestObj = {
      "id": i,
      "default_model": model,
      "all_data_x": data.to_numpy(),
      "all_data_y": target.to_numpy(),
      "train_index": train_i,
      "test_index": test_i
    }
    # send request Object and "await" reply
    replyObj = self.services[i].exposed_train_on_fold(requestObj)
    print(f"Fold {i} complete")
    # consolidate to results
    results.append(replyObj)

  return results
```

`distribute_folds` is then called to initiate the distribution of folds to the available servers, passing the data, target, and model. The data should be a `pd.DataFrame`, target being a `pd.Series`, and the model being a `LinearSVC`. Later on however, any `pd` objects are translated to an `np.array` before transmission, due to technical constraints with marshalling `pd` objects.

This `distribute_folds` methods then, similar to a classic CV approach, begins generating splits for each fold. However, instead of processing the data locally, it delegates the task to an external server, passing `requestObj` into the remote `exposed_train_on_fold` method. (more details on this later during the `Service.py` section)

Finally, this method consolidates the results of each server's calculations, and returns them as a list.

```py
# Distribute and Process the Folds
accuracy = skf.distribute_folds(data, target, best_model)
print(accuracy)
```

Client Output:

```
Fold 0 complete
Fold 1 complete
[0.9639308060360692, 0.9642988590357011]
```

#### Servers `Service.py`

**Running the Server**
The server can be run by simply running the `Service.py` file and entering the fold number of the service.

```
python Service.py
```

**On Server Run**

```py
fold = None
while True:
  fold = input("Fold Number: ")
  if int(fold) < 0:
      print("Please enter a valid integer of more than 0")
  else: break
```

Upon running the service, a fold number will be requested to be entered from the user. This fold number would be used to identify the service within the network. In the future, this number will be automatically generated based on the existing populations of servers.

```py
ALIASES = [f'FOLD{int(fold)}']
```

Server Output: `Fold Number: 2`

```py
from rpyc.utils.server import ThreadedServer

t = ThreadedServer(service=FoldService, hostname='localhost', port=1856, auto_register=True, listener_timeout=14)
t.start()
```

Then, the `ThreadedServer` component from rpyc is run with the shown configuration with the `FoldService` class being passed to the service parameter.

**On Client Connect**

```py
def on_connect(self, conn):
  print(f"Someone connected to {FoldService.ALIASES[0]} Service!")
```

When a client connects to a service, the service will print a message.

Server Output: `Someone connected to FOLD2 Service!`

**On Client Disconnect**

```py
def on_disconnect(self, conn):
  print(f"Someone disconnected from {FoldService.ALIASES[0]} Service!")
```

When a client disconnects from the service, the service will print a message.

Server Output: `Someone disconnected to FOLD2 Service!`

**Responding to Pings**

```py
def exposed_ping(self) -> str:
  print("Pong!!")
  return f"{FoldService.ALIASES[0]} Pong"
```

When a client invokes the `exposed_ping` method, the service will print `"Pong!!"` on the server while returning a message containing its alias with the word pong.

Server Output: `Pong!!`
Client Output: `FOLD2 Pong`

**Validating a Fold**

```py
def exposed_train_on_fold(self, requestObject: dict[int, LinearSVC, Any, Any, Any, Any]):
  # unpack object
  id, default_model, all_data_x, all_data_y, train_index, test_index = requestObject.values()

  # split all data into train and test based on given index
  X_train, X_test = all_data_x[train_index], all_data_x[test_index]
  y_train, y_test = all_data_y[train_index], all_data_y[test_index]

  # fit the model
  default_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  y_pred = default_model.predict(X_test)

  # evaluate performance
  accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
  print("got accuracy", accuracy)

  # return replyObject
  return accuracy
```

When the client invokes the remote `exposed_train_on_fold` method, passing along `requestObject`, the server begins performing the entire process of validation on the given fold. This is identical to a single iteration in a classic approach: performing a train-test split, training the model, then predicting. Finally, it calculates a performance metric (currently only supports accuracy). This accuracy score is printed out by the server and is passed back to the client.

Server Output: `got accuracy 0.9639308060360692`

#### Registry

The Registry is a default component of RPyC library and is created with reference to the [RPyC documentation](https://rpyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/utils_registry.html).
